Futuristic quasi-intelligent prototype cabbage helper.

== Description ==

This helps you to cabbage with The Events Calendar and other related plugins.

*It also serves a role as extension "test dummy" so we can simulate and experiment with different facets of the
extension experience.* If you are not a Modern Triber or haven't been invited to use this plugin then it's highly
unlikely you will actually want to use it, unless you really like cabbage. Even then it's really still very unlikely
you'd want this as the connection with real, edible cabbage is tenuous.

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins â€£ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins)_ via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
